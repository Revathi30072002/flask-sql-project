        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The body does not feel sad, the eye does not hurt, the hunger does not work, the suffering comes regardless of them all, and the 'effort' is to rise and heal the thing. 'Perseverance' means trying again and again without worrying about the failure of the effort. It takes perseverance to see behind every achievement performed. It is the diligence of the activists that is the basis for the progress of Indian society. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t2">Perseverance:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The one who tries relentlessly will surely get the benefit of it. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"It simply came to our notice then <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It pays to be realistic, "says Valluvar. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Perseverance is transcendent. Failure is the first step to success and you must persevere without fail. If you continue to do as the saying goes that, "even an ant will wear away the stone,if it keeps walking on it", you will surely succeed. We have to do what we can not do with the right person. The winner is the one who does not look at the obstacles and runs towards the goal as he sees the track. Aside from the ridicule of the convert, the one who does not render duty is sure to reap its benefits. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t3">Success of people with perseverance:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Many have shown the world that trying is not impossible. The cure for the deadly cancer was discovered by the Curie couple over many years of perseverance. It was Robert Bruce who persevered to recapture England. It was through his perseverance that the hero Napoleon, who began his mission as an ordinary warrior, split and was crowned emperor. "'Can't' is not in my dictionary," he said. Silambuch Selvar M.P.C. Thomas Alva Edison, also known as Makkupillai by his classmate, invented more than 1,200 items, more than his 40 years of perseverance. Japan, which surrendered to the United States in World War II, is now economically challenged by the United States because of the success of its efforts. Failing his engineering studies, the Eiffel World Wonder Tower became famous in Paris for his diligence. It was due to diligence that the Tamils ​​got the nickname of the first man to build a fort across the river Cauvery. It is no exaggeration to say that our mother Tamil was declared as a classical language by the Central Government due to the 60 years of efforts of the Tamil people. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t4">Obstruction to attempt:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hope is the source of life. Young people who listen to the opinion of the good and accept the opinion of the good will overcome their distrust and develop self-confidence. Sleep is an obstacle to our endeavor. That is why the sage Solomon said 2500 years ago that if you want sleep you will become poor. </p><br>
        <h2 id="t5">Conclusion:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The saying goes, "Those who try will be humiliated." So if we put aside our hope, laziness and sleep, get up, count and dare to do what we can, then we can do better. </p> <br>
