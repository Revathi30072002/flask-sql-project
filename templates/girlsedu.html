        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This state, which saw women as the source of power, the abode of education, why even as God. Yet in real life the tragedy of what they consider to be a commodity, a possession, and even a burden, continues to this day. He is only enlightened by the education of a man. But it should not be forgotten that in a woman's education the whole family lives with light. Bharathi, who believed that women should be educated in the society as well, sang <br> 
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Education should be developed <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; People are one for all". <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The deep idea that basic female education is the basis of a civilized society is spreading all over the world. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t2">Poets on the status of women's education:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;There are no poets who do not sing women <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"It's bad for women to touch the book <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The one who said that has disappeared. " <br>

           &emsp;&emsp;- Bharatiyar exemplifies the death bell by this poem  <br>

           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We girls came to host it in this world <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In reaching knowledge we girls are  <br>

            then to their husbands, and finally to their children. Women in the kitchen were despised as to what education was for. This situation lasted until the twentieth century. Is it possible to describe women as house chandelier and not promote enlightened education that removes the inner light? Is this justice? As they were furious. As a result, we see today that women are also getting higher education. </p> <br>        
        <h2 id="t4">government initiative:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Realizing that the country can only benefit from female education, our federal government has introduced a rare program called 'Education for All' and is taking full measures to provide education to all boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The female community, which was oppressed by the ruling class, is being revived by education. The demand for legislation to elect one-third female members of the legislature and parliament is growing. Women have set up self-help groups and are working with awareness. The situation has developed that only female education can cook a new world. We appreciate female education, remembering that the Greek genius Pythagoras, who lived many centuries ago, stated in his book that men and women should be treated equally in society; Let's create a new world. </p> <br>
