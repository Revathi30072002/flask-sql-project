           &emsp;&emsp; These lyrics of the revolutionary poet Bharathidasan are the touchstone that identifies Bharathiyar's poetic talent. Bhartiyar is such a qualified person. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subramania_Bharati" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subramania_Bharati" target="_blank" class="inessay-link">Barathi</a> , our famous Tamil poet, who worshipped Tamil as his Mother is the poet I like. </p> <br>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ettayapuram, a small town in the then Tirunelveli district of the southern part of Tamil Nadu, may have been proud of the birth of Bharathiyar. Bharathi was born in 1882 AD to Chinnaswamy Iyer, Ilakumi. His parents named him Subramaniam. Bharathi lost his mother at the age of four and his father at the age of 15. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t3">Education:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bharathiyar's interest in Tamil arose from his youth, as the crop was visible from the bud. His parents enrolled him in school when he was old enough. Bharathiyar's poetic ability began to emerge at the age of seven. Surprisingly, Bharathi composed the song Venpa at the age of nine. His father thought that Bharathi should become proficient in accounting and English. Bharathi's mind was obsessed with Tamil. He studied at Tirunelveli College and dropped out halfway through his studies. Bharati was sent to Kasi where he studied Hindi and Northern languages. Bharathi felt that the languages ​​he studied were used to feel the sweetness of the Tamil language. Realized the excellence of mother tongue education. "Foreign education is an abyss; the tyranny of living animals," he said. Bharati, who studied other languages, regretted that they did not understand any help for life. The education he received was' slave education; Body education 'said Bharathi. Bharathi's words that "multi-year mathematics did not make the celestial body a kind of celestial being" explain the futility of education at that time.</p> <br>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bharathi's Tamil scholarship earned him the title of 'Bharathi' at the age of 13. Sensing the excellence of Tamil, Bharathi exclaimed, "We can't find anything as sweet as Tamil in known languages." Bharathi was also well versed in foreign languages ​​like Hindi, Northern languages, English and French. Bharathi wanted the best texts written in other languages ​​to be translated into Tamil and used by many. Therefore, he expressed his desire to "translate other scholars' knowledge into Tamil". He wrote and published many poems and prose. </p><br>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bharathi's poems and prose are sweet and simple. Thinking skills are highly concentrated; Nourishing and uplifting; His works, which shatter the tenth obsessive reactionary thoughts and superstitions, are the adornment of Tamil.</p><br>
        <h2 id="t6">Patriotism:</h2><br>
        <img class="main_img" title="Cover page of the 1909 magazine Vijaya, published first from Madras and then from Pondicherry.

            Who sang a patriotic song that nurtured a sense of patriotism in our nerves. The world-famous poet Bharathi through the press Swadesamithiran and India developed the quest for liberation by publishing emotional news and clear articles. He took part in the struggle against the partition of Bengal. The English government sought to arrest Bharti. Bharathi went into hiding in Pondicherry and lived in hiding, thinking that the song should be sung instead of sleeping in jail. From there he nurtured the quest for liberation by his writing prowess. </p> <br>
        <h2 id="t7">Conclusion:</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Love, heroism, sacrifice, patriotism, devotion, emancipation, freedom and resistance to superstitions were the foundations of Bharatiyar songs. Bharati, who came to see an independent India, sang, "Whether we dance or sing, we have attained blissful freedom." Alas!
